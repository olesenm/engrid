ENGRID is an open-source mesh generation software with CFD
applications in mind. ENGRID uses the NETGEN library for tetrahedral
grid generation and an in-house development for prismatic boundary
layer grids. Internally, ENGRID uses the VTK data structures as well
as the *.vtu file format. To create grids for OPENFOAM® (OPENFOAM® is
a registered trade mark of OpenCFD Limited), the GMSH format can be
used. GMSH is also an excellent open-source tool to create surface
triangulations for ENGRID. It is planned to provide native OPENFOAM
support, hopefully in the 1.0 release (before the end of 2008). For
future releases, export capabilities for complete OPENFOAM cases
(including boundary conditions) and support for polyhedral cells are
planned as well.

ENGRID is released under the GPL and we hope that it is a useful
addition to the open-source CFD community. So far the implemented
algorithm proved to be quite robust and it does not require much user
interaction.

The initial development phase of ENGRID has been funded by the
European Space Agency.
